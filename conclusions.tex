We demonstrated that most of the time the computer vision techniques provided
good estimates of positions. Statistical inference techniques were relevant
to infer positions at moments in which the mouse is occluded by objects in the
arena, and are essential to estimate velocities and accelerations. With
simulated data we showed that statistical learning techniques allow to estimate
model parameters that lead to substantial improvements in position, velocity
and acceleration estimates. We used a well illuminated arena and measured mouse
positions with high-quality cameras. In this low-noise setting, we did not
observed substantial improvements in estimates of position, velocity and
acceleration by using models configured with learned parameters, in comparison
to estimates by model configured by hand-tuned parameters.
